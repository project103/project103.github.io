      <h1>10 Harry kane</h1>
      <p>
        Harry Edward Kane MBE (born 28 July 1993) is an English professional
        footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Tottenham
        Hotspur and captains the England national team. Regarded as one of the
        best strikers in the world, Kane is known for his prolific goalscoring
        record and ability to link play.[4][5] Born and raised in the London
        borough of Waltham Forest, Kane began his career at Tottenham Hotspur,
        where, after fast progression through the team's youth academy, he was
        promoted to the senior team in 2009, at age 16. He did not initially
        feature for the side, and was loaned out several times to clubs across
        the English football pyramid, including Leyton Orient, Millwall,
        Leicester City, and Norwich City. Kane's involvement at Tottenham began
        to increase following the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino as head coach
        in 2014. In his first full season at the club, Kane scored 31 goals
        across all competitions, was the Premier League's second-highest
        goalscorer, and was named PFA Young Player of the Year. In the 2015–16
        and 2016–17 seasons, Kane finished as the league's top goalscorer. In
        the latter campaign, he helped Tottenham finish as the competition's
        runners-up and won the PFA Fans' Player of the Year award. Kane
        registered his best campaign statistically to date in the 2017–18
        season, with 41 goals scored in 48 games across all competitions, and in
        the following season, he finished as a runner-up in the UEFA Champions
        League. In February 2021, he became Tottenham's second-highest all-time
        goalscorer in official competitions. He ended the 2020–21 season as the
        top goalscorer and top assist provider in the league. Kane has scored 49
        goals in 68 games for England. He appeared and scored at every youth
        level, and made a goalscoring debut with the senior team in March 2015,
        aged 21. Kane featured and scored during England's successful UEFA Euro
        2016 qualifying, and represented the country at the tournament itself.
        He was made the squad's captain from May 2018, before the 2018 FIFA
        World Cup. In that tournament Kane finished as the World Cup's top
        goalscorer, winning the Golden Boot, leading England to fourth place,
        their highest finish since 1990.[6] He also led England to second place
        at UEFA Euro 2020, marking their first appearance in a final at the
        tournament and their first major final since 1966.[7]
