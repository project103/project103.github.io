      <h1>17 Kevin De Bruyne</h1>
      <p>
        Kevin De Bruyne (born 28 June 1991) is a Belgian professional footballer
        who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Manchester City and
        the Belgium national team. He is widely regarded as one of the best
        players in the world, and pundits have often described him as a
        "complete footballer". De Bruyne began his career at Genk, where he was
        a regular player when they won the 2010–11 Belgian Pro League. In 2012,
        he joined English club Chelsea, where he was used sparingly and then
        loaned to Werder Bremen. He signed with Wolfsburg for £18 million in
        2014, where he established himself as one of the best players in the
        Bundesliga and was integral in the club's 2014–15 DFB-Pokal win. In the
        summer of 2015, De Bruyne joined Manchester City for a club record £54
        million. He has since won three Premier League titles, five League Cups
        and an FA Cup with the club. In 2017–18, he had a significant role in
        Manchester City's record in becoming the only Premier League team to
        attain 100 points in a single season. In 2019–20, De Bruyne tied the
        record for most assists in a Premier League season and was awarded
        Player of the Season. De Bruyne made his full international debut in
        2010, and he has since earned over 80 caps and scored 23 goals for
        Belgium. He was a member of the Belgian squads that reached the
        quarter-finals both at the 2014 FIFA World Cup and at UEFA Euro 2016. He
        represented Belgium at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where Belgium won the
        third place play-off match against England, and was named in the FIFA
        World Cup Dream Team. De Bruyne has been named in the UEFA Champions
        League Squad of the Season and the IFFHS Men's World Team four times
        each, the UEFA Team of the Year and the ESM Team of the Year three times
        each, the France Football World XI, and the Bundesliga Team of the Year.
        He has also won the Premier League Playmaker of the Season twice,
        Manchester City's Player of the Year three times, the PFA Players'
        Player of the Year twice, the UEFA Champions League Midfielder of the
        Season, the Bundesliga Player of the Year, the Footballer of the Year
        (Germany), the Belgian Sportsman of the Year and the IFFHS World's Best
        Playmaker twice.
