        as of 29 March 2022 Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly (Arabic: محمد صلاح
        حامد محروس غالي, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mæˈħam.mæd sˤɑˈlɑːħ
        ˈɣæːli]; born 15 June 1992) is an Egyptian professional footballer who
        plays as a forward for Premier League club Liverpool and captains the
        Egypt national team. Considered one of the best players in the
        world,[6][7] he is known for his finishing, dribbling, and speed. Salah
        started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon, departing in
        2012 to join Basel, where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014,
        Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11 million, but limited
        gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and Roma, who later
        signed him permanently for €15 million. In 2017, Salah was the subject
        of a then-club record association football transfer when he signed for
        Liverpool for £36.9 million, becoming the most expensive Egyptian player
        of all time. There, Salah won the Premier League, the UEFA Champions
        League, the League Cup, the Premier League Golden Boot twice, and
        finished third for the Best FIFA Men's Player in 2018 and 2021. He also
        holds the record for most Premier League goals scored (32) in a 38-game
        season, and ranks as Liverpool's ninth-highest all-time top goalscorer.
        At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level before
        making his senior debut in 2011. Following his performances at the 2012
        Summer Olympics, he was named CAF Most Promising African Talent of the
        Year. Since then, he finished as runner-up in the 2017 and 2021 Africa
        Cup of Nations and was top scorer during CAF qualification as Egypt
        qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Salah was named CAF African
        Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), BBC African Footballer of the
        Year (2017 and 2018), and was selected in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations
        Team of the Tournament, 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the
        Tournament and the CAF Team of the Year on several occasions.
